# Beads - AI-Native Issue Tracking

Welcome to Beads! This repository uses **Beads** for issue tracking - a modern, AI-native tool designed to live directly in your codebase alongside your code.

## What is Beads?

Beads is issue tracking that lives in your repo, making it perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want their issues close to their code. No web UI required - everything works through the CLI and integrates seamlessly with git.

## Quick Start

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues

bd list

# View issue details
bd show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
bd update <issue-id> --claim
bd update <issue-id> --status done
```

### Working with Issues

Issues in Beads are:
- **Git-native**: Stored in Dolt database with version control and branching
- **AI-friendly**: CLI-first design works perfectly with AI coding agents
- **Branch-aware**: Issues can follow your branch workflow
- **Always in sync**: Auto-syncs with your commits

## Why Beads?

✨ **AI-Native Design**
- Built specifically for AI-assisted development workflows
- CLI-first interface works seamlessly with AI coding agents

🚀 **Developer Focused**
- Issues live in your repo, right next to your code
- Works offline, syncs when you push
- Fast, lightweight, and stays out of your way

🔧 **Git Integration**

*Beads: Issue tracking that moves at the speed of thought* ⚡

## Current Status (as of 2026-06-16)

**Beads Tracker Status**: The embedded Dolt database is currently unavailable due to filesystem permission issues on WSL2. The files in `.beads/embeddeddolt/sandbox/.dolt/` are owned by user `node` but the agent runs as `yolo_agent`.

**Workaround**: Issue data is available in JSONL format at `.beads/issues.jsonl`. You can use the following Python script to query issues:

```python
# Query beads from JSONL
grep -v "^Warning:" .beads/issues.jsonl | python3 -c "
import json, sys
lines = [l for l in sys.stdin if l.strip()]
issues = [json.loads(l) for l in lines]
for i in issues:
    print(f\"{i['id']}: {i['title']} - {i['status']}\")
"
```

**Status**: Open - needs filesystem permission fix or Dolt database recreation.
